# Data Ingestion and Text Classification

This hands-on lab demonstrates the application of the Azure ML Text Analytics Package for text classification. 

In this lab, we will:
- Build a simple pipeline by using a Scikit Learner and ingest data
- Set the parameters of pipeline steps
- Evaluate the trained classifier
- Save and load the pipeline for scoring

### Learning Objectives ###

The objectives of this lab are to:

- Understand the text classification workflow
- Get introduced to a text classification pipeline using TATK
- Understand how to ingest datasets into the workflow
- Understand how to perform pre-processing by changing the pipeline's parameters
- Learn how to build the text classifier using different Sckit Learners and perform evaluation
