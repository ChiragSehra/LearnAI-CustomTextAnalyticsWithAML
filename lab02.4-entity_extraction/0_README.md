# Entity Extraction

This hands-on lab demonstrates how you can train a custom entity extraction model using TATK.

In this lab, we will:
- Load benchmark biomedical datasets for extracting biomedical entities
- Utilize a word2Vec embedding model to define the entity extractor pipeline
- Save and load the scoring pipeline on unseen data
- Compare with generic entity extractors

### Learning Objectives ###

The objectives of this lab are to:

- Understand entity extraction applied on Pubmed abstracts
- Understand how to develop entity extractor pipeline and evaluate the performance of the pipeline
- Demonstrate that domain-specific word embeddings model can outperform generic word embeddings models
